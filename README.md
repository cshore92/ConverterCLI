# ConverterCLI
CLI version of Converter Program. This was the original model for the GUI Version


This program is a WIP for converting to binary, hexadecimal, and decimal.
This CLI version is a model for the GUI version.
The CLI version is not proper programming practices that you will see with comments I've made throughout development.
I decided to split up the two programs for clarity of the projects.
